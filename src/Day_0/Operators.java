        a = 0011 1100
        b = 0000 1101
        -----------------
        a&b = 0000 1100
        a|b = 0011 1101
        a^b = 0011 0001
        ~a  = 1100 0011

        & (bitwise and)
                |Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
                |(A & B) will give 12 which is 0000 1100
        | (bitwise or)
                |Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
                |(A | B) will give 61 which is 0011 1101
        ^ (bitwise XOR)
                |Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
                |(A ^ B) will give 49 which is 0011 0001
        ~ (bitwise compliment)
                |Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
                |(~A ) will give -61 which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.
        << (left shift)
                |Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
                |A << 2 will give 240 which is 1111 0000
        >> (right shift)
                |Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
                |A >> 2 will give 15 which is 1111
        >>> (zero fill right shift)
                |Shift right zero fill operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand and shifted values are filled up with zeros.
                |A >>>2 will give 15 which is 0000 1111
